ðŸŽ¯ My goal: to leverage my deep technical expertise and creative problem-solving skills to build impactful, data-driven, and AI-powered platforms that drive business growth and innovation.

ðŸ‘‹ Hello, Iâ€™m Thomas Shields, a full-stack software engineer with a passion for building scalable web and mobile applications. I specialize in modern tech stacks like TypeScript, React, GraphQL, and also work with advanced technologies such as Elixir, Phoenix, Terraform, and AWS.

ðŸ’» My expertise includes designing cloud architecture, crafting APIs, and managing complex data systems. Iâ€™m proficient in using AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, CDK), Serverless, Docker, and Terraform to build robust, secure, and scalable infrastructures. On the backend, I work with Node.js, NestJS, and Elixir, while my frontend experience covers React, React Native, and Next.js.

ðŸ“Š I have a strong focus on data-driven development, utilizing PostHog for product analytics to suggest, plan, and build platforms based on real user behavior and data insights. This enables me to deliver optimized and highly effective solutions that meet both business and user needs.

ðŸ§  In addition to my professional work, Iâ€™ve built several applications integrating AI. One notable project is an AI-driven tool that helps teams plan the discovery phase of their projects, streamlining the process by gathering requirements and providing suggestions for technical architecture.

ðŸš€ Whether it's refactoring complex systems or architecting AI-integrated solutions, I focus on delivering maintainable, clean code. I'm also passionate about using SonarCloud to ensure code quality and Prisma for database management.

ðŸŽ¨ Outside of software, I love organizing immersive events that blend the digital and physical worlds. I also experiment with generative art projects using code to create unique visual experiences.
